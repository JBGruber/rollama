Chat with a LLM through Oolama
}
\details{
\code{query} sends a single question to the API, without knowledge about
previous questions (only the config message is relevant). \code{chat} treats new
messages as part of the same conversation until \link{new_chat} is called.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# ask a single question
query("why is the sky blue?")

# hold a conversation
chat("why is the sky blue?")
chat("and how do you know that?")
}
}
