Ollama also supports multimodal models, which can interact with (but not create) images.

We start by loading the package:


``` r
library(rollama)
```

After loading the package, we need to pull a model that can handle images.
For example, the [llava](https://llava-vl.github.io/) model.
Using `pull_model("llava")` will download the model, or just load it if it has already been downloaded before.



``` r
pull_model("llava")
#> ✔ model llava pulled succesfully
```

We can use textual and visual input together.
For instance, we can ask a question and provide a link to a picture or a local file path, such as `images = "/home/user/Pictures/IMG_4561.jpg"`.

In the first example, we ask the model to describe the logo of this package:


``` r
query("Excitedly desscribe this logo", model = "llava",
      images = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JBGruber/rollama/master/man/figures/logo.png")
#> 
#> ── Answer from llava ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#> This is an image of a stylized logo featuring a cute cartoon character, which appears
#> to be a character from the game "RollerCoaster Tycoon". The character is depicted
#> lying down, wearing a blue helmet and with a contented expression. Behind the
#> character, there's a hexagon that resembles a shield or emblem, with text on it that
#> reads "ROLLERCOASTER". To the right of the hexagon, there's a badge-like design with
#> the word "ROLLOMAN" prominently displayed in white letters against a dark background.
#> The overall style of the image is reminiscent of retro video game graphics, and it
#> likely represents a gaming community or organization related to the RollerCoaster
#> Tycoon franchise.
```

The second example asks a classification question:


``` r
query("Which animal is in this image: a llama, dog, or walrus?",
      model = "llava",
      images = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JBGruber/rollama/master/man/figures/logo.png")
#> 
#> ── Answer from llava ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#> The image shows an animated character that resembles a llama. It has distinctive
#> features of a llama, such as the large head with two rounded horns and a fluffy,
#> fur-covered body.
```
