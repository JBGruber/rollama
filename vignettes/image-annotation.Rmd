```r
library(rollama)
```

Ollama also supports multimodal models which can interact (albeit not create) images.


```r
query("Exitedly desscribe this logo", model = "llava", 
      images = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JBGruber/rollama/master/man/figures/logo.png", 
      model_params = list(seed = 712))
#> 
#> ── Answer ───────────────────────────────────────────
#> The logo is an animated animal, specifically a teddy
#> bear or possibly a white rabbit. It's laying on
#> grass, wearing a hat and has a happy expression with
#> its mouth open in what appears to be a smiley face.
#> This whimsical image creates a sense of fun and
#> playfulness.
```


```r
query("Which animal is in this image: a llama, dog, or walrus?", 
      model = "llava", 
      images = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JBGruber/rollama/master/man/figures/logo.png", 
      model_params = list(seed = 712))
#> 
#> ── Answer ───────────────────────────────────────────
#> A llama is in the image.
```
