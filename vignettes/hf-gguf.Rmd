If you are looking for a model to use, you should probably search for it on the [Ollama website](https://ollama.com/search).
However, the models listed there are not all models that can be used in (r)ollama.
Models in the GGUF format from *Hugging Face Hub*, a very popular platform for sharing machine learning models.
To look for a specific model, all you need to do is visit <https://huggingface.co/models?library=gguf> (this is already filtered to GGUF models, other model formats are not compatible with Ollama).

Once you have identified a model, you can simply pass the URL to the `pull_model` function:


``` r
library(rollama)
pull_model("https://huggingface.co/oxyapi/oxy-1-small-GGUF:Q2_K")
#> ✔ model https://huggingface.co/oxyapi/oxy-1-small-GGUF:Q2_K pulled succesfully
```

Note that the `:Q2_K` at the end is the [quantization scheme](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/en/concept_guides/quantization).
Q2_K is the smallest available version of the model, which gives up some performance, but is faster to run.
You can find the different quantization versions when clicking the `Use this model` on a model site.
When downloading, Ollama converts the URL automatically into a name, we need to query our model list first to see how the model is named now:


``` r
grep("oxy-1-small", list_models()$name, value = TRUE)
#> [1] "huggingface.co/oxyapi/oxy-1-small-GGUF:Q2_K"
```

But except for the awkward name, we can now use this model as any other one:


``` r
chat("Why is the sky blue?", model = "huggingface.co/oxyapi/oxy-1-small-GGUF:Q2_K")
#> 
#> ── Answer from huggingface.co/oxyapi/oxy-1-small-GGUF:Q2_K ───────────
#> The sky appears blue to our eyes due to a process called Rayleigh
#> scattering. Sunlight entering the Earth’s atmosphere collides with
#> the air molecules, causing them to scatter in all directions.
#> Nitrogen and oxygen make up about 95% of the earth's atmosphere.
#> 
#> When sunlight encounters these gases, it gets scattered widely
#> throughout the sky. Shorter wavelengths of visible light fall within
#> blue’s wavelength range; thus, when sunlight scatters into our eyes
#> as blue light, we perceive a blue sky.
#> 
#> However, at sunrise and sunset hours, the sun is lower on the horizon
#> compared to noon time. As such the path of sunlight passes through
#> more atmosphere than usual, which causes the longer wavelengths (red)
#> to dominate over shorter ones, giving us the shades of red hues like
#> pink or crimson skies.
```

Note that this also works with [text embedding models](https://jbgruber.github.io/rollama/articles/text-embedding.html).
Hugging Face Hub has some nice filters with which you can pre-select appropriate models and then use full text search to find more.
This search looks for embedding models with the correct model type, for example:

<https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=sentence-similarity&library=gguf>

The trending models are often quite good for general tasks, but more information is available in leaderboards and blog posts.
For no particular reason, let's use Snowflake's Arctic-embed-m-v1.5 embed for demonstration purposes here:


``` r
pull_model("https://huggingface.co/Snowflake/snowflake-arctic-embed-m-v1.5:BF16")
#> ✔ model https://huggingface.co/Snowflake/snowflake-arctic-embed-m-v1.5:BF16 pulled succesfully
embed_text(c("Why is the sky blue?", "I am pretty happy we can work with GGUF models in R"),
           model = "huggingface.co/Snowflake/snowflake-arctic-embed-m-v1.5:BF16")
